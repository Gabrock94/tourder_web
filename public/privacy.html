<p>I love privacy almost as much as you do. For this reason, I am truing to avoid collecting any personal data, and all the information that are obtained from your device (e.g. location) are nor kept nor stored. However, the services I use to make this spaghetti code work may do. In this Privacy Policy I will be as detailed as possible about what data are collected, and what third parties may have access to. Tourder is designed with a privacy-first approach. I am not collecting your personal information, and whenever sensitive data are processed (e.g. location), I am taking every step to ensure the safety of such data.

This Privacy Policy applies from November 21, 2023</p>

<h2>Who am I</h2>

<p>My name is Giulio Gabrieli. You can contact me at tourderapp@gmail.com, or to my personal contacts, which you can find at www.giuliogabrieli.it.</p>

<h2>Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to app (Tourder) and website (tourder.app). For simplicity, I refer to all of these as “services” in this Privacy Policy. 

Some of the third party services have their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy applies. </p>

<h2>Information I Collect</h2>

<p>Would it be for me, i’d collect zero informations. However, the way the service works, is as follow. First, your location is retrived via yuor device GPS. The location, expressed in coordinates, is then converted to a location expressed as city name, geocoding package (https://pub.dev/packages/geocoding), which in turn is based on Android’s location reversed geocoding (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder). This is the only stage in which your exact location (coordinates) is used. Subsequently, the location (city name) is passed to Open Street Map (https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via the Overpass API (https://www.overpass-api.de/). This is done to obtain a list of points of interest (POIs) around you. The two services as access to your location expressed as city name, not your precise location (coordinates). Finally, each POIs is searched on Wikipedia via the Wikipedia API (https://en.wikipedia.org/api/), from which images and information about the POIs are obtained. 

As such, this services may have access to your location, as well as IP address and device’s information. </p>

<h2>Information you give Tourder</h2>

<p>None. However, third parties may be able to collect some information from you.</p>

<h2>How I Use y Information</h2>

<p>Your location data is used as express in point 3 to provide you with POIs around you. Additionally, I use the information about your device’s language to provide you with a wikipedia in your preferred language, if available.</p> 

<h2>Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>

<p>Please check the privacy policy of the aforementioned third parties to better understand how they process your data. </p>

<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>

<p>Device permissions. Mobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone contacts, pictures, location services, push notifications and advertising identifiers. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. However, if you block the access to your location, the app may not work. 


<p>Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. </p>

<h2>How Long We Retain Your Information</h2>


<p>Your information are never collected by me. I simply don’t have the time or the will to bother about it. So I went for the KISS approach and removed the problem by not collecting your data.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>


<p>I am working on this app during my free time, and I built it for myself first. As such, I am exploring new services, API, and libraries. Given that different services may rely on different policies, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p>

<h2> How to Contact me</h2>

<p>you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact me at tourderapp@gmail.com.</p>
